TEST_PLUGINS_MISMATCH.message = Incompatibles tests modes are required by test plugins (${requestedKernelMode} mode requested but already in ${incompatibleKernelMode} mode).
TEST_PLUGINS_MISMATCH.fix = Please be sure that you don't have test plugins having opposing requirements on the test class ${testClass}. If you can't reconcile those requirements, consider splitting the test class in two or more classes.
